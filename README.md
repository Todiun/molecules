# ðŸ§± Eventbrite UI Kit

This project is a front-end exercise based on the **Atomic Design** methodology.  
The goal is to build reusable **molecules** and **organisms** for an Eventbrite-like web application using **Bootstrap** and a **Bootswatch theme**.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `index.html` â€” Main page linking to all components  
- `navbar.html`, `footer.html`, `banner.html`, etc. â€” Individual pages for each molecule or organism  
- `assets/css/style.css` â€” Custom stylesheet  
- Bootswatch theme included via CDN

- **Navbar**  
- **Footer**  
- **Authentication forms** (login, signup, password reset, password change)  
- **Banners** (large for home page, small for inner pages)  
- **Cards** for events, users, and cities  
- **Card lists** (event list, participant list)

## ðŸš€ Goal

The aim of this project is to design and build a clean, reusable front-end component library that can later be integrated into the **Eventbrite Rails application**.

No Rails application is used for this exercise â€” only **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.
